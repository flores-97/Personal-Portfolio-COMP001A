<!--The section below is a brief biography of what I enjoy about web development.-->
<h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I hope to be a dependable web developer and have enough knowledge to help me in my future career. 
    I enjoy how difficult this process is and how much of a puzzle it is like. It still amazes me how
    my ideas are simple lines of text but yet transform into websites.
