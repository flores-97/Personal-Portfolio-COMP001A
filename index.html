<!--The section below is a brief biography of what I enjoy about web development.-->
<h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring web developer with novice experience in creating web applications. I am dedicated to the craft and quick to learn new skills. 
        I look forward to solving issues with teams, gaining experience, and helping many people along the way. My favorite part about my new career path 
        is having my ideas come to life and sharing it with anyone to see. 
    </p>
